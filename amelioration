I have carried out a complete analysis of your SaaS SEVEN T. Overall, the architecture is very solid and professional, especially for a project using JavaScript (Node.js/React). You have already integrated advanced security practices and a rich set of features.

Here is the requested diagnostic and my proposals:

1. Weak Point Analysis (Audit)
   🛠️ Code Quality
   Lack of TypeScript: For a project of this size (+25 routes, multiple complex services like WhatsApp and AI), the absence of typing makes maintenance risky. You could easily introduce "undefined" errors during refactoring.
   Logic Duplication: Some business rules (like calculating quotas or credits) appear several times. It would be safer to centralize them in a Domain Service.
   Large CSS File: Your

index.css
is quite heavy (32kb). Moving to a more modular component approach (CSS Modules or more advanced Tailwind usage) would improve initial loading.
Asynchronicity in Loops: In

auth.js
, you use for...of with await for agent cleanup. This is sequential; for better performance, Promise.all could be used where appropriate.
🔒 Security
AI Rate Limiting: You have an aiLimiter defined in

security.js
, but it's not strictly applied to the Playground (/api/agents/:id/test). A user could spam AI calls and quickly increase your costs.
Token Invalidation: Your JWTs are "stateless". If a user changes their password or logs out, the old token remains valid until it expires. Implementing a simple blacklist (in Redis or DB) for "logged out" tokens would be a plus.
Double Sanitization: You sanitize inputs on the backend AND React escapes them on the frontend. While safe, this can sometimes lead to double-escaped characters (e.g., ' appearing as &#39;) in the UI.
🚀 Functionality
WhatsApp "Brittle": Using Baileys is powerful but depends on a permanent connection. If the user's phone is off or has no network, the agent stops. You lack a "Status" alert system (Email/SMS) to warn the user if their agent is disconnected for more than 1 hour.
Error Visibility: Users don't have access to "AI Logs" to understand why an agent responded in a certain way or if a knowledge base fetch failed. 2. Innovative Feature Proposals
To differentiate SEVEN T from simple "Chatbots", here is what would make it a "Revolutionary" tool:

🎙️ Vocal Intelligence (WhatsApp Voice):
Integrate OpenAI Whisper to "listen" to voice notes sent by clients.
Respond with a voice note using ElevenLabs or OpenAI TTS. An agent that "speaks" on WhatsApp is a huge selling point.
👁️ Visual AI (Vision):
Allow the agent to analyze photos (receipts, broken products, room measurements).
Example: A client sends a photo of a dress, the AI identifies the model and gives the price instantly.
📊 Predictive Sales Analytics:
Use AI to analyze conversation trends and predict which products will be in high demand next week.
🌍 Real-time Auto-translate:
An agent that talks to a tourist in English but saves the lead in French for the administrator.
🔗 Advanced Integrations (No-Code):
A dedicated "Webhooks" module to send captured leads directly to Google Sheets, Zapier, or a CRM without manual export. 3. Improving the Home Page (Landing)
Your current landing page is clean and modern, but it lacks "Proof Transfer":

Product Screenshots: Replace some icons with high-quality "Mockups" of the dashboard or a WhatsApp conversation. People need to see the interface before signing up.
Interactive "Live Demo": Instead of a separate chatbot window, integrate a "WhatsApp Mockup" directly in the hero section where users can type a message and see the AI respond in real-time.
FAQ Section: Essential for SaaS. This reduces support tickets and improves SEO.
Video Demo: A high-speed 60-second video showing: 1/ Scan QR Code, 2/ Write prompt, 3/ Automatic response. This proves the "5-minute setup" promise.
Comparison Table: "Classic WhatsApp Business" vs "SEVEN T" (e.g., Human only vs 24/7 AI, No stats vs Advanced Analytics). 4. Technical Improvement Recommendations
Area Quick Win Long-term
Security Apply aiLimiter to the /test route. Implement a Refresh Token system.
Performance Use gzip or brotli compression (Nginx/Express). Migrate the core logic to TypeScript.
UX Add a "Status" indicator for the WhatsApp agent in the header. Create a mobile app (PWA) for managing agents.
SEO Add Meta Tags (OG:Image, Twitter Card) in

Landing.jsx
. Create a "Blog" or "Use Cases" section.
